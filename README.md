# Capstone2
A repository for my second capstone project for the Springboard Data Science Career track, "Automatic Sentiment Analysis of Tweets about the COVID-19 Pandemic." 
Here you will find raw and processed data, documentation, and project notebooks dedicated to data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and modeling.
